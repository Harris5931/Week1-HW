# Week1-HW

This HW assignmwnt was about configuring the CSS file in the DRY format. It also was about adjusting div the tags in the HTML file.
I have made numerous amounts of attempts at completing this in a fashion that I would have liked to, but the assignment did give me a little struggle.
I noticed that I had copied the files to work on in VS. However, I did not sync them to the appropriate repository in GITHUB =(
Which left me with a "rabbit-hole" of attempts for solutions and a additional change to the primary code.
As of now, my code is within the original and I can only link, the link, to the code I have altered.
